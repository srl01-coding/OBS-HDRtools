/*
 * Luminance-dependent threshold multiplier T(Y) = T * m(Y) (docs/denoise/NOISE_PROFILE.md;
 * decision C of docs/denoise/HIGH_BITRATE_ANALYSIS.md). Shared by HQDN3D temporal, spatial B,
 * NLMeans and motion-compensated temporal.
 *
 * m(Y): piecewise-linear in log2(nits) between up to 6 anchors, constant outside them,
 * clamped to [min_mult, max_mult]. n = 0 is the identity profile: m = 1 exactly, so every
 * filter is bit-identical to the profile-free version. The production curve is NOT
 * frozen; built-in profiles are development options.
 *
 * The double and float versions use the same operation order as profile_mult() in
 * data/effects/hdr-program-denoise.effect.
